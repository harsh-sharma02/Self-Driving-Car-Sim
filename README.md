# Self-Driving-Car-Sim
This repository contains code for a simple self driving car simulator project which I developed mainly for learning the basics of machine learning. This project helped me to master the fundamentals of ML and core concepts of autonomous vehicle behaviour such as obstacle avoidance. This project is built using JavaScript and runs directly on HTML5.
